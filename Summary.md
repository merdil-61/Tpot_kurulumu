**SUMMARY**
Honeypot systems are virtual machine systems that emulate real servers in order to mislead cyber attackers and analyse their attack methods.
These systems play an important role in protecting sensitive data, especially in corporate companies.
Honeypots prevent attacks before they are directed at real systems, while at the same time providing valuable data to understand the attack vectors and strategies of threat actors. 
In this context, the T-Pot honeypot platform, which stands out with its versatility and user-friendly interface, offers a comprehensive cyber security solution by integrating different honeypot types. 
T-Pot stands out with its ability to visualise and analyse attacks.
In this study, the functioning and effectiveness of T-Pot is analysed through a DDoS attack scenario. 
T-Pot honeypot setup was performed step by step and a DDoS attack was applied as an attack scenario. 
Network traffic was analysed with Wireshark and open ports were detected using Nmap. The attacks carried out by the attacker via Metasploit were specifically targeted via Telnet (port 23).
All attacks were directed to the honeypot system and recorded in detail by honeypot. Log data were analysed with tools such as Nginx, Suricata, Cowrie and Spiderfoot and the results were visualised with histograms and scatter plots.
The analysis clearly showed that the attack was directed against the honeypot system. 
This study shows that T-Pot honeypot systems are an effective tool in data protection processes in corporate and industrial companies. 
The integration of T-Pot is very important to improve the security of real systems and to analyse threat actors.
Such systems have an important place in cyber security strategies, providing a more proactive approach against attacks.
